# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Report: Rossmann Pharmaceuticals Sales Forecasting

## 1. Introduction
This report presents the findings from the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Rossmann Pharmaceuticals Sales dataset. The analysis aims to provide insights into the sales data, understand key patterns, and prepare the data for predictive modeling.

## 2. Data Overview
### 2.1 Datasets
The analysis involves three primary datasets:
- `train_data.csv`: Training dataset for sales prediction
- `test_data.csv`: Test dataset for model validation
- `store_data.csv`: Additional information about stores

### 2.2 Data Loading
Data was loaded using a custom `load_data()` function from the `data_loader` module, ensuring consistent and reliable data import.

## 3. Sales Distribution Analysis
### 3.1 Sales Distribution
Key Observations:
- The sales distribution appears to be right-skewed
- Most sales are concentrated in a lower range
- There are some high-value sales outliers

### 3.2 Sales Over Time
Key Insights:
- Sales show temporal variations
- Potential seasonal patterns are evident
- Fluctuations in sales across different time periods

### 3.3 Sales by Store Type
Key Findings:
- Different store types exhibit varying sales performance
- Some store types consistently outperform others
- Potential factors influencing store type sales

## 4. Data Preprocessing Insights
- Custom data loading mechanism implemented
- Visualization functions created for comprehensive analysis
- Multiple data sources integrated for holistic understanding

## 5. Recommendations for Further Analysis
1. Investigate factors contributing to sales variations
2. Explore correlations between store characteristics and sales
3. Develop predictive models considering temporal and store-specific features

## 6. Limitations and Considerations
- Outliers may impact model performance
- Seasonal variations need careful handling
- Store-specific nuances require detailed examination

## 7. Conclusion
The EDA reveals complex sales dynamics across different stores and time periods. The insights provide a strong foundation for developing accurate sales forecasting models.
